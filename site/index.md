**[Heart on my sleeve - a place for my thoughts.                                [~]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------]**

My name is Jane Doe. I am a high school student pursuing research in
the fields of robotics and computer science. I am most interested in designing
tiny, self-contained, autonomous robots that take inspiration from the
morphology of insects. I am also intrigued by robotic exploration algorithms,
machine learning, and operating systems (specifically Linux).

My current research involves the use of reinforcement learning to prune dynamic
graphs that are used as part of robotic exploration algorithms, in order to
reduce the amount of information that must be stored and thereby improve the
performance of exploration. [Read more about it here](/projects/robot-graph-pruning.html). I have also recently
started working on a second project involving [safe intelligent control for](/projects/safe-control-aircraft.html)
[multi-agent systems](/projects/safe-control-aircraft.html).

Besides these academic interests, I have been an avid origami enthusiast for
over ten years. I've folded hundreds of models and also designed a few of my
own. I have also recently picked up bonsai. You can check out some of my
creations via the tabs at the top.


About this site
===============

This website is primarily meant to be a place to showcase my projects, write
about my interests and hobbies, and collect my thoughts in one place.

The site itself is built using 'sed' magic to insert plaintext / markdown-ish
documents into an HTML template using <pre> tags to preserve formatting. I
borrowed the idea from the [Kiss Linux website](https://github.com/kisslinux/kisslinux.github.io), and it works quite nicely.
