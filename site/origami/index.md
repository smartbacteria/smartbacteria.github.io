**[Transforming a simple piece of paper into art.                       [~/origami]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------]**

I picked up origami at a really early age, and since then I've folded hundreds
of models and designed a few of my own. On this page, I've posted some pictures
of the models I'm most proud of.

I also have a few [ongoing projects](/origami/ongoing/). Status updates coming soon™!

*[Stag beetle from Robert Lang's Origami Insects and Their Kin. I folded this to
try out some new double tissue foil paper I got. The paper was thicker than I
was expecting, but that gave the model some really nice heft (and saved me from
ripping it more than once).

#[!![hummingbird](/img/origami/hummingbird.jpg)]#
*[This hummingbird is one of my original designs that I'm quite happy with. This
was one of the rare times that experimenting with random variations of the
traditional origami bases led to something recognizable.

#[!![kangaroo](/img/origami/kangaroo.jpg)[80]]#
*[Based off ?[this dragon by Jo Nakashima](https://jonakashima.com.br/2015/07/24/origami-dragons), this kangaroo is in some ways also
one of my original designs. It even has a pouch (formed from what were
originally the wings on the dragon).

#[!![frog](/img/origami/frog_new.jpg)[80]]#
*[Robert Lang's Tree Frog, Opus 280 from Origami Design Secrets. This is the
second time I've folded this model. The level of detail is truly amazing, and I
really love how it turned out.

#[!![dragon](/img/origami/dragon.jpg)[80]]#
*[The ?[Devil Dragon by Jo Nakashima](https://jonakashima.com.br/2021/02/17/devil-dragon-v3). I regret not starting with a bigger piece of
paper, the eyes were really hard and I ended up accidentally ripping the paper
in a few places including the eye on the other side of the head.

#[!![chameleon](/img/origami/chameleon.jpg)[80]]#
*[Another ?[Jo Nakashima design](https://jonakashima.com.br/2021/11/10/origami-chameleon). It sits perfectly on the edge of my desk (or in
this case, in a tree, lol).

*[This was another model from Origami Design Secrets. It's slightly simpler than
the frog, but still really cool nevertheless.
